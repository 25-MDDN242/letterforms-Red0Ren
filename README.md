## MDDN 242 2025 Assignment 2

All characters use a maximum of 4 lines and 1 square. I was aiming for simplicity.  All the vowels only use lines, all the letters without a "hh" like sound at the end of their pronouciation or a vowel ('f' 'l' 'm' 'n' 's' 'x' 'z') have all lines either inside the box or  no lines. Most letters are visually based on the english alphabet, with  the exception of all the vowels and the letters without a "hh" like sound at the end of their pronouciation. 'b' and 'c' are purely random. 'w' is based off a window. 'z' is based off zebra. For the defaut character, I had no  idea of what to do, so I  just drew a turtle. All the numbers are based on mandarin chinese characters using the limiting square and lines.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `size` : square size
  * `degree` : square rotation
  * `squareX` : square x co-ordinate
  * `squareY` : square y co-ordinate
  These variables repeat according to which line it is, e.g. for line 1 it says `1_lineW` whille for linne 2 it says `2_lineW.`
  * `1_lineW` : line 1 width
  * `1_startX` : line 1 starting x coordinate
  * `1_startY` : line 1 starting y coordinate
  * `1_endX` : line 1 ending x coordinate
  * `1_endY`: line 1 ending y coordinate
